## How to Install
Navigate to the folder containing your YGO client and locate the `puzzles` subfolder. Enter this folder and do one of the following:

### If you are familiar with git...
`clone` this repository in your `puzzles` folder. Whenever new puzzles are added, simply `pull` from the repository to retrieve them.

### If you are not familiar with git...
Click on the `Code` tab above and select `Download ZIP`. Unzip the downloaded file in your `puzzles` folder to `ygo-puzzles-pqr`. Whenever new puzzles are added, download the new ZIP and replace your existing `ygo-puzzles-pqr` folder.

## How to Play
Open your YGO client and select `Puzzles`. If you installed correctly, you should see an option called `ygo-puzzles-pqr`. Double click that option and navigate to the puzzle you would like to play. Highlight your selection and click `Load Puzzle`. Good luck!
